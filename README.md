# Pantheon_Data
Here, we are analyzing data from supernova observations to shed some light on the present values of the density parameters $\Omega_{m}$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$ and hence get an idea about the present state of the universe.

Scolnic et. al (2018) combined the subset of 279 SNe Ia (0.03 < z < 0.68) data, discovered by the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) Medium Deep Survey, with useful distance estimates of SNe Ia from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), SNLS, and various low-redshift(z) and Hubble Space Telescope samples to form the largest combined sample of SNe Ia, consisting of a total of 1048 SNe Ia in the range of 0.01 < z < 2.3, which is called the “Pantheon Sample”.

In our analysis, we are exploring the flat ΛCDM model. For the flat ΛCDM model, Ω = 1. We want to produce 68% and 95% confidence contours on the $\Omega_{m}$ - $\Omega_\Lambda$ plane. Thus, our underlying parameters are $\Omega_{m}$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$ . Instead of marginalizing over the over two parameters $M$ (Absolute Magnitude) and $H_0$ (Hubble Parameter) , for simplicity, we fix $M = −19.26$ and $H_0 = 72.9$ km/sec/Mpc.

We approximate the distributions as Gaussian for purposes of choosing the contour levels. We plot the confidence levels considering only statistical error. We do not include the systematic error.
